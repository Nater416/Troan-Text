# Troan-Text
Troan v1.0

This is a simple text based game developed by Nathan R. 

I mean this game to be simply a goal that I can work towards while learning Java and understanding the basics of coding. 
I don't intend to release this game in any way, shape, or form. In such an early stage, feel free to clone the game and edit it yourself.
